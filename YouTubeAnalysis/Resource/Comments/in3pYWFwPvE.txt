What I really like about your videos is, they're not just a cooking video but also a therapy for the soul at the same time. The vibe is really chill and relaxing and there's Dawang's cuteness to top it all. Keep up the good quality contents Dianxi‚ù§Ô∏è

I love how nothing is wasted. its so amazing seeing your family come together and make a meal.

I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate your videos! I learn so much about your culture and traditions through the foods you prepare and eat. I love to watch how your family eats your dishes because they each do it a little bit different according to their personal taste preferences. I also learn table etiquette from your family too. Each culture has different table etiquettes and I really enjoy learning about them. Thanks again.

I think this is the fourth year I'm watching Dianxi, and ever year she records the annual pig festival. By now, I'm familiar with what she's making (the blown pig liver, blood sausages, and preserved bones) but I still watch every video as if it's the first time. ‚ú®

Thank you Penji, once again! Love that you share your family's annual pig festival with all of us! We just love the all of your video's. I look forward to each and every video-they give me peace and happiness! Thanks for sharing the neighborhood and the whole process of the pig festival. So much work and pride go into the preparation! Keep the video's coming-again thanks and Happy New Year!

You and your family are amazing. I so enjoy watching yall work together on creating amazing meals and the love between you. Thank you for sharing this with usüíó

I love her recipes and her videos, too. And I like when you guys treat Dawang a part of the family rather than just a pet. Keep up the good quality content Dianxi so I have great videos to watch here on YT world.

You know what, I‚Äôve always looked forward to your pig annual feast every year. Even though they are the same, I love the vibe, love how busy people are, love how people play their own part and work harmoniously together, love how you use every part of pig and turn it into delicious dishes, and love how everyone sits and enjoys the feast. I was even worried you wouldn‚Äôt do this video this year because you did one last year already, but thank God here is this year‚Äôs annual feast video. Thank you

What I love about your videos is that we see from the beginning to the end of how food is taken from the farm to the plate! Thank you so much for sharing I absolutely love your Cuisine!

This reminds me of my family. Every holiday we would celebrate together. Grandparents, aunts, uncle etc. 30 of us eating together home cooked meals. Loved watching this video

Hi Dianxi Xiaoge! My mother and I love your videos very much. We are  always waiting for your new uploads.  Your videos relieves our stress so please continue making more ‚ô•Ô∏è Sending love from the Philippines!üáµüá≠

I appreciate how much culture is show cased in this vid,  the part of preparing and cooking food together, and then eating together,  one of the cultural traits I'm glad we've retained from our Chinese ancestors.

I just love how everyone comes together and do what they have to do, I really do enjoy watching her video‚ù§‚ù§üôèüôèüëçüëç

These are so well shot! Love seeing another culture and how much time they put into meals

Your every episodes brings me lot of surprises and love to see the cuisine which is somewhat similar to our culture. I am a big fan and would love to explore your place one day. Love from India.

Great to see family and friends working so hard! Then celebrating together..

Hi Penji, ( I hope I got that right) As always it is a joy to watch you and your family work as one team with a common goal, you are obviously many things to many viewers as your feedback comments suggest, I sincerely hope your life is as happy as it appears in your videos. Your piano music accompanied, productive and fruitful shining life brings vicarious sensations of great satisfaction and calmness, unfortunately we have lost much of that values associated with that type of productive cooperation. I am a farm boy who got lost in the city/world many years ago, I like many I suppose swim in the tide of modernity always clinging to and maintaining some of the most basic things that our parent and elders taught us, you are an inspiration to many in many ways, I particularly enjoy your amazing use of almost every piece of that big old pig and the many other things you use. Your cooking is mouth watering to say the least, I swear I can smell the aromas as you prepare your food and I swear I can almost taste those sausages, the thought of your hams send my mouth into fits of delirious salivation, a million blessings on you and your family, may we always live in peace. Thank you again for sharing, I like many others look forward to future videos.

It's always joyful to see a family helping each other to prepare food and eating together. ‚ù§

I love your videos, so calming and even though you live all the way around the world, I feel connected to my culture as a Chinese American. My mom experienced something similar when she was a kid growing up in China and watching this video in a way helps me understand my family and myself

I love how she takes Dawang everywhere with her or if he is not with her, She is always thinking about him in some way or another ‚ù§Ô∏è. I love watching these videos just to see this sweet family/village work hard, play hard, love hard together. It is a nice change of pace from how things are in the USA ü•∞

Aw, how come Dawang couldn't have any food? ü•∫ So impressive how everyone works so well together. Also, nothing goes to waste. Incredible work to all of you üòäüëç

I thoroughly enjoyed this feast. üòÉ. It was as if I was sitting right there with your beautiful family and friends.

So wonderful!  To see so many people come together and help out during the Pig feast is heartwarming.  All the laughter and love you are truly blessed.

You are an amazing cook, your food always look so delicious and the presentation is beautiful!

You bring such joy and comfort to your wonderful videos. They show all sides of your life not just bits and pieces. Hard working family and so much love and happiness ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

So nice to watch your show, it reminds me a lot of my life and my family; we used to do the same things when I was growing up in my native PERU. Now we live in the USA, life here is totally different, no one can do these things here, so is so pleasant to watch your show. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Keep up the good work. LOVE, from Minnesota, USA

Ahhh I love your videos! Relaxing, and really fun to watch. I was eating a lame ole corndog while you guys feasted.

Love this video. Love how you showed from the rooter to the tooter,  NOTHING WASTED. That streaky pork did look good. I know it was.

I love the whole family going in together.

I really like the interaction in your family. It feels too good to see you all happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Dianxi, the relationship u have with ur sister is really amazing, and she is so sweet and funny ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ

Your home is so beautiful and I love the fields the mountains and culture I wish I can go visit there and taste your cooking.

Hi Dianxi Im one of your fan from the Philippinesüòä please continue to make such wonderful videos. ‚ù§

I love how close your family is. And your home is so beautiful. And of course, I love seeing you and Dawang. Thank you for sharing. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Dawang should have his own channel. So adorable ü•∞

Wow so amazing to see you all again.....what a homely family you have.....sharing in every work...in every bite....in every love....üíñ....Following you since two years back....my sister and I stayed in different places so we miss eavh other alot....so one day we try to shared our youtude favourite channel and surprisingly we both shared your channel which make us laugh out as we were following your channel without even telling or knowing that it was our favourite channel....Thanks for sharing your love through your videos...lots of love from India

I watched you all do this event last year with much fascination and love in my heart for the community and family that gather around to help and feast together it is so nice to see festivals and feasts like this still exist and bring people together with love and friendship

I remember how good fresh pork was, roasted crisp and juicy, once a year in the fall, we would butcher hogs from daylight to dark, afterward grand ma would roast ribs, fry up heart and liver, it was a magic time 65 years ago, I love watching you and your beautiful sister participating in those tasks, bless you Apenjie for sharing time and love.

Your very special Penjie even I don't know you but I feel your very nice üòä   Your very lucky most of your food are very fresh and you have lots of fruits ü•∞

I got nothing else to say but satisfaction to the core‚Ä¶.love everything about it. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I've been watching her vlogs since then. Really entertaining üëç love how she values family more than anything ‚ô•Ô∏è

Dawang is such a good boi I hope he gets a lot of treats

That good looked great. I want some streaked pork made like that. I made chicken tacos for the family but that pales in comparison to the massive feast you had with your family.üòÇ keep up the good work and Dawang is just wholesome.

Amazing! I love that the whole community comes together and that every part of the pig is honored!

Love the smile of grandma wearing a red hat, so lovely!

Possibly the most interesting thing I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶I‚Äôm blown away. And everyone is so skilled, I‚Äôm just dumbfounded.ü§Ø

I remember as a kid watching my elders do this.  They all came together slaughtered a hog and spent the day cooking. Needless to say this has stopped.

That last meal they cooked look so good. Roasted pork dipped in sauce. Wish they'd tell the recipe for that dipping sauce

That is a perfect example of how a family should work together and share with each other... I love your videos. They help me escape and dream. Keep going with your wonderful jobüòçü§©

I can smell the cooking all the way here ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Da wang is such a good boy! I love how dian xi xiao ge talks to da wang. Exactly like how i talk to my dogs. They are like kids to us. And i love this festival video. Reminds me of how it used to be when i was a kid. Ppl came together to help and celebrate.

When you want to calm your nerves, just watch her videos. üòç

I love watching your videos, learn a lot about the style of cooking & culture <3 *pats for dog*

I would love to be their Neighbor ‚ù§Ô∏è

Beautiful work and thank you for sharing it all with us.

the way she calls her relatives and the relatives call her really reminds me of my family back in hometown. "ace" "yeye" üíú

love these videos, food always looks yummy

You need to write a cook book.  The food you make looks amazing!!!

Its been a few years now.  everytime i watch your video, i thought it would be such a honor if ever allowed to be participated in the video. I miss the nature

I like how this feast bring your family and relatives together! Your grandma( mother‚Äôs mom), did a good job with that 200 kilos of a pig! Happy New Year, may this year be as prosperous as the last and may you continue to have good health and peace! GOD blessüôèüåüüí•‚ú®

Haha Dawang is so cute. "You're heavier than the pig." And fighting with the gooseüòÇ

In Portugal üáµüáπ we have the same ritual, pigs are klilled in November, December, in Winter, and we preserve all, make blood sausages to, but without tofu üòÉ, very similar!

I like how they are using most of the parts instead of wasting it!

So much wholesome teamwork!

Peacefully family, joyfully family, the way family take care your mom is so lovely n good,you all will get blessing from grandma n grandpa,,.

üëçüëåüëè Very well done again and as always (video, work and cooking). Best regards luck and health to all of you.

Half of the village came out to work together on the pig.  Now that‚Äôs what I call community spirit.

It will be a dream come  true to have a sister like Dianxi and eat every dish she prepares :-)

Dawang is so cute, and love to see everyone enjoying the feast ‚ô° much love.

All are so hardworking I missed our village life love from japan üòç

You are very good girl, you cook well,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I am generally from Georgia and Chinese dishes are foreign to me, and I like it very much‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.

Love how you make Dawang a part of the family rather than just a pet. Shows great compassion and love on your part.

Hello from Russia!  I love your videos!  You are an excellent cook!  And you have a wonderful dog!

i love how they use every part of the pig (thats edible obviously). im no vegan but i believe that theres always a respectful way to eat animals and thats by not wasting any of their parts. where i grew up we even used the pig's blood.

Itself so nice to look and mesmerized the countryside.    I miss those time

Me and my mom eagerly waiting for your videos really enjoyed a lot to see your videos

I always think it's very amazing how nothing get wasted. Not the head, not the organs, the limbs, the bones, not even the blood were wasted. And that's how it should be for every food we eat, we shouldn't waste anything

They help me escape and dream. Keep going with your wonderful jobüòç

This video really relief my strees & I love to see when family members enjoyd dinner

the dogo just blocked the irrigation water was so cute üòÇ

Lovely Family, Greetings from Hungary ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã

It‚Äôs so amazing how communally food is treated where you live. There seems to always be enough for everyone and you can just go pick what you need from nearby farms. So different from the states. I really would love to visit, truly one of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve ever seen. Love how everything just flows and works with unspoken and mutually understood rules

Beauty with the art of cooking ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è love your videos.. üëçüëçüëç

i love how they use every part of the pig and don't waste it

We love being here watching these delicious dishes, it gives you nothing but joy üòäüôèüëç‚ù§

Hi, could you also show how you wash and dry the utensils used in preparation, cooking and eating? I would really like to know how this is done in a eco friendly way

Omg, i like you filmed it... lovely family.. ‚ù§‚ù§

Thanks for another heartwarming video and mouthwatering foods~üòä Just curious, is A-xia A-penjie's sister or cousin? Didn't saw A-hao in this one too. =3=

Hoping that there's english translation...i love your video but i cant understand the conversation...im just imagining how happy and interesting your conversation with your family.

The sausage stuffing reminds me so much of when I was young and we were doing a similar project with my mom and aunts but we were also doing it for the first time! This went much more smoothly than with my family haha! but the conversation and community is the same ‚ù§

Nature, cooking, family, self reliance and love. Oh and Dawang. He gets s special shoutout.

Love from Assam (India) Dianxi ....we north east Indians love pork meat very much üòã

Dawang does make me laugh he really be testing her patience lol

Love your videos!

Blood sausage was my favourite, but can‚Äôt find a similar one in Ottawa. Had seen a French cuisine chef made one on YouTube .

I am from India and I love to watch your video. It's very nice. üòä

Every year I learn something new and it does feel so good to see everyone so happy.  Thank you for including us.

it's too good too watch !! Thanks for sharing !!

Penjie‚Ä¶I loved watching the annual pig roast. Tell me, is the young girl wearing the Cookie Monster jumper‚Ä¶.is she your younger sister? How could I have missed this detail? We all know about your handsome younger brother‚Ä¶but I‚Äôd no idea that you had a beautiful younger sister as well! The three of you are extremely pretty! Tearing down the pig must be heavy and hard work. But you all always look as though it is great fun. I believe this to be true.  Happy New Year!!!!

Hi, always watching ur vlog, keep safeüòçüòçüòç

Hello, iam from Indonesia ‚ù§ Dawang is so cute üòö

this is such a nice family actually  here in the phliphines in IGOROT tribe here in Cordillera we have the same method how to butcher the pig and the proper how we will preserve it. its just nice to see that we are not the only one who do that.we only butcher the pig occasionally. more contents to come. i really like your videos because i can really relate to it maybe because i live in a province just like the surroundings in your videos we have cold climate too...

Dawang he was so cute and adorable what's he doing is really funny

Hi! I am a great fan of your cooking... the way you explain everything is really impressive... you are not a chef you are the magician who knows science behind every recipe.

I enjoy watching your videos ü•∞

‚ù§Ô∏è you Dawang and your family from USA üá∫üá∏

Here in Tennessee in the USA we also find joy at pig killing time.  Only the pig thinks otherwise. ‚ù§Ô∏è

It wouldn't be possible without team work... üòÄ

Hi ..I'm from India northeast nagaland.. seeying this cute family wish I like to join urs n have that pork meat.. n hav a nice chat..looks so beautiful n healthy family‚ù§‚ù§

I just love pork ‚ù§Ô∏è, love from India.

I‚Äôve never seen anyone cut meat with scissors before! üíö

what i learn from this video is 'Family is everything'.

I am amazed that so many people left comments in all kinds of languages, nice video

Love watching your videos

it's my 4th year watching her annual pig feast. time really does flies so fast!

Do you open the intestines when cleaning them? If not, how do you make sure they're clean? Also how long do all of these preparations take before the actual feast?

This is the another annual video...‚ù§Ô∏è

When she lifted Dawang to the 2nd row of the truck, she said: You are even heavier than the pig.  So funny. My dog is 130 pounds, I cannot lift him at all.

I love how festivals gather people amd relatives together. This is what I miss most in this pandemic.

It's a blessing being with the family... enjoying even the smallest one. üò•

I love this family

How is it so natural? The people, the action, everything

Beautiful video and a lot of hard work goes into butchering a hog. Watched some of that when I was a kid and the ladies and the men worked a full day and then some the next. I‚Äôm glad I have those memories. Yes it takes a family and lots of hands to reap a harvest.

I love these videos. I'm  going to have a homestead one day and I can't wait to have a feast like this with my family.

I love how the goose wasnt backing down frow dawang xxxx

What a wonderful day of many people making the work go well. A real sense of community and celebration.  Happy New Year to you all.

Chonky doggo always giving us smile

Nothing is better than a family feast. Love all your videos

Love from North-east India‚ù§Ô∏è

This reminds me of a traditional Cajun "boucherie" in Louisiana in the US. Get everybody over to eat as much as possible, and then work like crazy to preserve the rest. It's funny how circumstances made similar traditions evolve around the world.

Just goes to show how important food is for a culture and bringing people together.

Every year I wish i was a part of this this

dianxi  i like this so much. nice presentation. surely, ill come back to see more. thanks.

Omg they eat everything I‚Äôm just amazed they didn‚Äôt waste any part of the pig

I don‚Äôt know why but i feel the uncle Ping is that one person in the family who didn‚Äôt want a dog, and now that he was one he spoils it the mostüòÇüòÇ

So enjoyed watching your video, wonderful

This is my favorite video, it‚Äôs the way family‚Äôs used to share, work, food, love, we lost this lifestyle 50 years ago, watching you and your beautiful family makes me happy, may God bless you all!

I love how you guys use all of the pig! Some people discard a lot of it instead :/

I really wished you had English subtitles

The most happy life that you can't buy them ,doesn't matter how rich you are,this is very happy life for me,spending time together with friends in the village,cooking ,join meal togetherand laughtüíïüòäüòçüòÖ‚ù§

Community preparing and feasting together - beautiful!  I just realized they probably do not have refrigeration.  So they need to either cook, pickle, or cure it.  My mouth is watering!

That's a lot of work. hahahah I'm tired just watching you. Lovely people ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

Thank you for taking such good care of the pig before and after it died. Really appreciate to see people respect the being who will die to give bring them food. It didn't want to die, but at least it was treated correctly and respected.

Hi sister  I'm neela In Tamilnadu  Very nice your place

Nice video

Dianxi where is your brother nowdays ..I hope he is alright..

New year wishes to everyone around the world..stay hale and healthy.

Such a nice sight to watch. Different cultures n different kinds of food. But one thing is always common. Love between family. Well I hv a doubt.... Is it ok to eat raw pork? Won't that harm our tummy

your video was good view and make feel relax

I, I, I know it‚Äôs kind of weird but I feel bad for the pig üê∑, especially on the last night of its life‚Ä¶ poor piggy üò¢   I think I‚Äôm lucky enough to not have to kill a pig and can just get pork in the market. I might have forced to turn vegan if I need to kill to eat‚Ä¶ üòµ‚Äçüí´

Was the pig alive when they poured hot water on it and started skimming him ü•∫

Always look forward to your videos. I didn't like how your aunt treat dagwa. He is just curious she should have not hit him like that. Poor doggy.

The pigs color while alive is white!! Why it turned black when it si being cleaned?? Or it another pig??

you need to keep that dog on a leash when going to other places, he would havexeasilly killed someone's livestock aka that goose. he is not playing

Hey all! :) Any Italians here??

They used two pigs? One white and one black pig?

3:13 were they boiling the pig's head alive?!

Pity for üê∑ü•≤

Kinda felt bad for the pig :(

where is ahao..??

I love to watch her every video till she made but in this she didn't liked her behaviour with her cousin when she is prep for liver recipe,not good to see also

I have a question.  China is blocking YouTube, and if you get caught, you will be punished.  How do you keep the channel running? Is it possible with mcn papitube?

Idk if it‚Äôs me or dawang seems like he‚Äôs gotten so big. They feed him too much unhealthy food. He seems like he need to lose some weight. Or maybe it‚Äôs just his fur coat that make him look big? ü§î and don‚Äôt feed your dog bones it‚Äôs not good for them.

Great video. I love how you used all the part. Its sad because here in our country pork is very expensive due to AS. Great to see you enjoy the food you made.

It is wonderful to see your family happy and together. Grandma looks so good! Love watching u cook with all the spices. I like watching your happy family.

I enjoyed this video of all of the family working and eating together. Great work!

I hope DaWang feels better after his adventures while collecting the pig.  Delicious video as always. I‚Äôm happy your sister was so helpful

So beautiful how family and friends work together ‚ù§Ô∏è

It is very good to have such an excellent family to help with all that hard work! Thank you so much for sharing Dianxi, and my mouth was also watering seeing your delicious dishes cooked with the pork! I feel sorry for Dewang that he was not feeling well and wasn't able to share in the feast! ‚òπ

I've been so excited to see the pig feast this year! My favourite part is when you make meats for hanging- the ham legs, and especially the sausages! ‚ù§Ô∏èüêñüçΩÔ∏è All my love to you and yours Dianxi.

This is so fantastic and beautiful üëåüòä Country to Country in this world has wonderful similarities in some things üêñ Despite of difference in languages üêΩ In the Cordillera Region of the Philippines, friends and family gather together with the neighbours whenever there are special occasions to help on slaughtering pigs and cows üêñüêÑ And preparing food that will be shared to anyone in the community. The rest of the meat (specifically the pig meat) will be preserved with salt into what they called "Etag". Happy Feast üéâüêΩüêΩ

Such a lovely neighborhood  Good food  Good mood

Amazing nature,,rice terrace ,mountain,the street in the village love it ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

What a beautiful dog! I'm in love for him ‚ù§

Apenjie is a beautiful, hard working woman. I really admire her work ethic and her love for her family. And Dawang.

This reminds me of my childhood.. We have a neighbor who's a butcher. They usually kill 1 pig every saturday. I always watch them cleaning it up after. Just so fascinated. Then they'll cook parts of it in what we call dinuguan. They also fry the fatty parts to render it for pork oil

Always wondered how long does it take from preparing the ingredients (cutting vegetables and slaughtering the pigs) to finishing marinating them (before set aside to dry/ferment).

nne loves to see how everyone comes together as a family to make their meals and celebrate

It‚Äôs as if these merry folks were put on this earth for EATING lol  Mad love for the videos ü•É

I am amazed that all of you did so much cooking and slaughtering but you and everyone looked so clean‚ÄîI would have been such a mess! I look forward to seeing Dawang getting a bone or two.

A part when they break the bones so easier to cut, bit barbaric..  The sounds of crack give me chill. üòÖ But the video of togetherness like this, really awesome. And the cooking is amazing.  Loveeee it!  And yes, many said that your videos always a nice therapy, indeed. ‚ù§

üòáThis is Amazing üëç waiting for long time too see the videoü•∞, And now am watching, love too see the beautyüòç of yunan. Plz make video of nature üåøüçÉkeep doingüôè

Relaxing and educational regarding keeping up with the family values..

All family cook together. So happy !

How I wished I could live this country life .... Greetings from the Netherlands

I really like dawang in your videos.. he is so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è

I find your videos so amazing to wach anything you cook look so yummy ü§ó

I remember when I was younger my family used to slaughter pig during our yearly festival and they have the same technique as your family. I missed those days. Now we are in the city and life is never the same during festivals. Your life is a dream, Apenji.

Nothing is wasted, they ate the pig inside and out üòÄ. Family and friends get together to cook and eat. What not to love ?ü•∞

I want a pig fest. üòãüòç

You always showed your family. And that thing I really liked.

So excited for this!

*I am from Mizoram, India, Pork (pig meat) is the best in the world, intestine, legs and head are the best part and delicious too..No.1 meat in Mizoram* üëçüëçüî•

Ive been wonderingü§î why does the liver need to get inflated like that? Is it just a cooking technique or is it important for some other reason?

Dianxi listenüòîüòî.. I'm kirti from india..and one day I meet with you..you know what how I love your videos..you are amazing girl üòò

I love roasted pork or pork BBQ ! yummy!

I adore that dog

Last few weeks your Videos English Subtitles are missing why??

Wow beautiful video

Bad Dawang, fighting with the goose! üò°üòÖ

No need for a Christmas day. You have your pig festival day. But the present you give each other is your hard work and effort in making so much good food so that everyone can share in this harvest of porky goodness. This present may not come wrapped up with shiny bows and ribbons but to me it glistens like the bright lights on a Christmas tree.

Please make your house tour video

hy i love your video im allways watching ..

I like your video

NICE VIDEO ! But is soo sad when u show how to kill the pigs! RESPECT YOU TRADITIONS BUT U DONT NEED TO SHOWS THE PART

üòôüòôüòôüòôüòôüòôüòôüòô

The girl with the cookiemonster shirt looks like real fun!

Please can sister send dry pork to India manipur imphal

Poor Dawang being sick and cannot have bones..

If you could also put English subtitles sense some of your subscriber cannot understand chinese language

I do not like watching them take the pig to slaughter. It made me cry. I know our meat comes from live animals but I have to disconnect emotionally from that. I couldn't watch the rest of the video.üòü

Feel so sad

How much you cost per hour?

Try Pakistani food

NOICE

One pig brings together the whole family to prepare a feast, & enough meat for a whole year. The important message is family unity.   Isn't it about time for Dawang to get a mate to produce some puppies? ü•∞üòò‚ù§

Covid didn't hit in to these people's town!!

what are those white cubes at 11:11 ?

I don't like this video because your all are eating two times in a day and you all not looking at Dawang, very sadüòî also you are not feeding him, not good at all

Axia is cool

Where‚Äôs your 2 little brother??

Hii my name is   jagadeesh I am an Indian

if this was a vegan channel ild be in heaven..

Hi friend how are you

Why Didn't you give dawang at least a slice üòë I am so sad for him

Heartless! to see an animal screaming for its life and the human heart has no compassion...then to make a bloody feast of its flesh with spices and seasonings!! All for the sake of appetite!

You're so chill, if uncle ping spoke to me like that, i would've probably lost it. "Hurry up and cook something" , uhm. Sir. Who tf are you talking to like that ? üòí

Haram ygy

not to be rude, but how do you know if the pork is ok to eat raw? i was internally panicking about salmonella lol

Poor piggy üòî

Wild bad dog and poor gosüò•

Totally wrong to kill any animal love animals save animals be vegan and save lives. üíßüå±

I have liked all your videos except this just because I don't like the rude behaviour towards Dawang by that lady, dawang seems to be very obedient so such kind of behaviour towards him is intolerance

Gosh these guys ate whole pig even guts, legs, feet, skin, blood, brains‚Ä¶ are we still living  in old Stone-age?

Upoo

too stingy so Dawang is not given meat

Peppa???

Why that lady hit dawang like that tho?? (7:14) üò°

English translation pls

I like your video but this one better you don't let people see how to kill a pig  to sad..

You tube is completely banned no one is allowed to use it in China ......there is a very strict law and a very harsh punishment for anyone who are found breaking the law..... So how is this women on you tube ? I don't understand this at all...... Who and how she got the permission to run a YouTube channel.....

Please don't kill pig...üôèüôèüôè

Your cooking skills are so good and delicious. I wish I could eat dishes cooked by you.

I just love your videos, they make for enjoyable watching. Thank you for letting us into your life.

Dianxi i really love your videos I'm expecting like from you iam from India

Here in our village we don't have such festival, if one family butcher a pig then we have to  sell it to 30 - 50 families  to consume it all. We have 21-25 yuan per kg here. How much it cost in your place? Lolüòú  From Northeast India. Love your videos.

Hi, I 'm a big fan and I've been watching you for over three years now but I'm upset because I can't read the English translation because it's really tiny this time and before it used to disappear so quick, please find a solution for the sake of your English readers fans and even Dawang channel I had the same problem. Thank you.

"The annual pig" sounds like some kind of boss in an rpg.

I love seeing the cultural and traditional aspect of your presentation But sadly as I am an Animal Advocate I decided to unsubscribe the channel as you didn't treat animals equally. You love your dog but you killed the pig.

I was big fan of her and liziqi but in this video she showed something which was disturbing to watch and even think also... I know that it's normal everyone have non veg items but u should have shown direct meat and not the whole thing, u bought that innocent looking pig and later u all did something to him later u all cut the pig, instead of that direct meat could hv been shown... No offence. Its just wat i didn't like

She killed pork.  oh no

Disgusting.

I love the way you guys live. So peaceful!!

Your dog üêï is so adorable üòá, lots of love from india üáÆüá≥

Oh wow that's a lot of meat and I look forward to see the recipe that you guys making. Yummy!

Very good üôÇ

So interesting! In Hungary we don't use hot water to remove the pig hair, we use fire üî•Nowadays it's done with flamethrower but traditionaly they put hay pile on the pig and burn it down.

Sub Thai pleaseüòç

I love dawang‚Ä¶ so naughty üòÇ

As we all are not familiar with all the languages thats why it would be better if you provide us English subtitle so that can understand the conversation and enjoy more...really in love with you...lots of love & blessings from Bangladesh.. ü•∞

3:37 "....

Heart Disease

Where is ahao? The real ahao?

Bb

Please stop killing animals

Liziqi where

How can you love one animal so much and have the heart to kill the other ?? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ what is the difference between the two? It broke my heart to see how that pig was killed üíî

Pig is not halal in islam

How do they  kill the pig

üò°üò°üò° poor pig how they kill it so sad

Pig is haram...

Not a vegetarian by any means‚Ä¶ but I still feel so bad for the pig!! But what I love about Asian cooking is that NO PART goes to waste. I like to think the pig didn‚Äôt suffer.

How can someone kill a life so brutally. He was also the creation of the God just like us. I am proud to be a Sanatana who believes in living and letting live. I feel so pity for you guys who don't have humanity alive. You guys are living monsters which we have read in our holy books like Ramayana and Mahabharata.

why did you not try to eat beef???  thats more deliciuous ...

Am sorry to say that its very very insane pig is alive another he is slaughter by somebody....what type of festival is that i dont understand....very disappointed every year

so they don't wash the raw meat

How saaad!!!
