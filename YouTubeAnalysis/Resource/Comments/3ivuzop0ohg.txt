Prostitution and obscene problems seem to be connected to orphans (Sex between men and women,things to give birth to children).
Those who are married but will not have children and those who have a lot of lewdness can help to get rid of obscene sex if they must not eat pork, octopus,octopus, and squid.
We have to make lives that are not ashamed to others with things that do not have sex with non-married people and healthy lives without prostitution.
