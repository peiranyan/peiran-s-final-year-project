You make the best recipes in general but the way you make mooncakes is really beautiful. I want to try making them one day because of you 🙏
Wonderful!  I never thought about adding powdered milk to my desserts .... but from now on I will use it too!  Thanks for this recipe and all your great ideas!🔝
I followed your recipe for the snowskin wrappers and it was a success! Wrapped store bought lotus paste with them. Smooth and yummy wrappers (: thank you for your recipe!
These mooncakes look so good!! I think I could eat a fews at once 😋. I just made some today actually but with slightly healthier ingredients so I don’t feel so guilty 😂.
What a lovely mooncake 😍
Such a long process to get the right result 
Great preparation 👍
Wow using beetroot for colour was really good I have heard of using beetroot instead of chemicaled colours but I didn't saw anyone trying it but moon cakes were amazing thank you for sharing this recipe.
Just in time for the fall Harvest Moon season. Thanks for the recipe! Your channel is awesome!
So beautiful...I prepare the black bean paste already and when my mooncakes mold arrive from Amazon on Monday I will definitely try your recipe. Thanks so much and you too stay healthy.
I just finished making these snowskin mooncakes and they are in the freezer. I used beetroot powder and little bit of water to colour half of my dough, then I combined it with the white dough to create a marble like effect. In total I had 15 filling balls and 18 wrap balls. so I don't know what happened there but it's not a big deal. I found my filling a bit soft so I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes to firm up. I'm excited to eat these! Thanks for your recipe!
Hi! I really liked your recipe. I have a question. How many days can we keep in the fridge? Thank you for your videos and have a good day :)
You never failed to provide all d useful tips in your videos. I applause u for that. Thanks to you, I finally nailed snowskin mooncakes. This custard filling is yum.
I'm so excited to watch your new vid on Mooncake every year. I've made both of the previous ones and they are delicious. Thank you!
I love your recipe, I got it right on my first try! Thank you so much 😊
wow this is beautiful, it's not as hard to make as i thought it would be! thanks for the recipe
U're amazing sist... 👍
I remember eating moon cake as a child, my father was made before. But when my father died, he forget to give his moon cake recipe to me. Then now, i found the recipe from ur channel.. 

I learn so much food knowledge from ur channel, especially about mozzarella cheese, homemade butter, then learn how to turn soy milk into butter (based on ur video tutorial), thanks sist 🙏
Thank you! Just wanted to find a recipe to make moo cakes and you came out with a video ☺️
Am just watching this because it's so neat and beautiful! I will never make a moon cake because I will never get all ingredients and the moon cake press. But it's so satisfying to watch❤️
So excited to make the recipe. Is there any substitute for wheat starch?
Thank you for such a great recipe! For the 冰皮 wrapper, is it okay to replace the milk with soy milk or does it need the fat from the milk?
Wow, amazing! That looks very tasty and a pleasure to eat and enjoy! I'm so glad you posted this professional video, thanks for sharing! It's nice seeing talented people sharing their work with others! Wish you all the best! Much Love, Home Cooking Journey channel♥️
We followed these instructions, but the wrapper is really sticky after steaming it and not firm like in your video. Is there a way to get it to the correct consistency?
For condensed milk i see you use spoon, did you use tablespoon or teaspoon? Is it necessary to use milk powder? Any replacement for wheat starch? Thanks
You have the best mooncakes on YouTube! I'm really excited to try this recipe.
