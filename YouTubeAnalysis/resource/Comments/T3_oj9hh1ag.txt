The production team of this channel is world class!! Very cinematic for daily life materials. Fantastic style and storyline to show the beauty of Chinese provincial life. 👍👍
I love everything about your videos, the quality, the filming technique, the timing and picture, the splendid family, the beautiful scenery and traditions, the food! Your culinary expertise... Everything!!
Omg the short ribs look so delicious!! I love when your niece comes for dinner ❤️ it looks like she really loves your food 😊
I’ve never seen anyone like you, it brings tears to my eyes to watch how much you love your family, enjoy it and put in your memory, it’s the worthwhile thing we all search for in life, mines already gone, swallowed up by materialism, bless you and yours!
I just can't believe how much Dawang has grown. It seems only yesterday he was a little puppy. Now he looks like a majestic creature of the mountains.
Dianxi: Can you make a video on how weddings are celebrated in your town? Please share traditions and of course; the food 👍😄. It would be very interesting to see weeding dishes.
Another wonderful video Penji I send positive thoughts and happiness and care from the snowy mountains of Colorado for all you and your family, keep conquering it out there, we are so grateful for what you  do, thank you!💛
Dawang is such a gentleman even compared to human standards! The way he sits in front of the meat so patiently is such a mesmerizing thing to watch!
Beautiful farm and family, such an abundance of fruit 🍎 vegetables 🥕🥦 everything looks absolutely fresh and tasty 😋
Dianxi is so beautiful and tender, and Dawang is so adorable. Their happy family is also amazing, the place they lived is also so beautiful. I really like her videos
I respect everyone who were involved in This is seriously the best piece that i ve ever seen on YouTube 💌 Hate off to well all 💟 love your videos !

If you could start using English subtitles again that would be great. Love Bev from USA
It's a very good and fun video And I'm glad to have Thai subtitles.
The food looks delicious.😍😍
Thank you so much for sharing your vlogs each month. I look forward to all of your posts. I'm so grateful for the English subtitles, it adds so much to be able to understand what's being said by everyone, sometime two different conversations around the dinner table all at once! I love it ! 😂 I like through the lens of YouTube to meet all the different neighbors and see the family coming together and enjoying themselves.
Super interesting with how they cure the meat in the open. Could it be that the sugar/salt/spices prevent insects from inhabiting the meat? I have no idea about the process.
Apenji you are amazing so gifted in all you do the food and passion you have is un parallel. I think you can do anything  you want.keep your focus and bkess you and the family and the village always.much love from a friend and fan of yours.🙏❤☺
The view is amazing. I love the style of cooking very refreshing.

Another amazing video. Thanks once again for the English subs and PERFECT use of slow motion shot on those ribs. The videos, music and editing just keeps getting better and better.
What spices did you sprinkle on the meat.. please I would like to try it out . It's looks so appetizing
Living this place would be awesome💜
I love to see a glimpse of their life.. bringing pears, leaving with pumpkins and ribs. Giving back. It is a beautiful way of life.
I envy you. You have such a variety of dishes. I don't have that in my culture. It is so amazing to see this. I wish I could make what you make..
Wow! Very nice recipe! 🤗 Looks appetizing! I am happy to find your channel. I like your video style. I make cooking 🍳 🧑‍🍳 videos too!!! I’m so thankful to be able to learn from talented creators like you! I’m happy to have found your channel.

Did anyone notice the red flowers adorning Juan's house? Also the evening view? Wowowow
what a high quality video😭 cant believe im watching this for free😭
I want also to try that kind of preservation in meat...🥰🥰🥰
your place can be called a little paradise on earth, so beautiful and amazing !!
I'm looking for a wife that can cook like this, lol. Love watching the ingredients come straight from the ground, or a self raised and slaughtered livestock. We in America can learn a few things from Chinese cooking traditions.
I really love your vids/cookings🥺. I've been watching your cooking vlogs since 2019 with my mom. She really likes you. We also love Dawang and Ahao and your hardworking grandparents. Sending hugs from the Philippines💕😃
Looks delicious thanks for sharing this
Geniuene question, do you have to pay for these crops that you always get? How does that work?
Dawang is my spirit animal LOL. Does what he wants when he wants. What even is rain?
The menu is unusual and very tasty.
Hi Apenjie how are you? Im from Philippines.Im always updated to your videos and i really love all your videos.I wish i could visit to your place someday.
It seems like dawang really love the rain 😂♥️
Hi! How are you?

Seoul is also cold and snowy this week. Wednesday - I hope you have health and good things for the rest of the week.
Is that Ahao?! He's all grown up now! It seems like only yesterday he was helping Penji in the kitchen and struggling with heavy things- so lucky to have seen this family grow over the years <3
Are insects ever a problem when air drying meat? Does the salt and spice drive them away?
It's very wonderful thing that your spreading your society culture with your videos 🤗🤗☺
I like to watch your videos 🥰 All the best my dear 😍 love from Sri Lanka ❤️❤️
Please take care of your health, your families and dawang, stay save
She has such a nice life always happy
Can you add English subtitles? Love your channel, with love from Michigan
What beautiful people…really feel the sense of community in every one of your videos. Wishing you and your family health, happiness and prosperity in 2022! ❤️❤️❤️

Feeling so relax when watching your video!
Simply amazing 🤩

Your cooking makes me so hungry! By the way, I notice I did not see your grandfather having dinner. Sorry to ask!
Very Beautiful Video

Fans from indonesia. Always get notified for every wednesday video.loveee you sisterrr... And dawang too. You totally bring happiness for me while watching your videos. Youre beautiful and perfect. ❤️
Ahao has gotten so old! I remember watching this channel years ago and he was still a young boy walking to and from school, I didn’t recognize him until she said his name. Much love to you and your family! ❤️
does she invest in something or does she have her own company? she continues to live the normal village life, but through the videos she certainly earns additional money to the family village shop and the sale of the harvest. what do you do with so much extra money without needing it to live?
Dawang: I'm the main character in the movie soaking in the rain... leave me alone
I'm jealous of her future husband.
I wish I could have Succulent plants like you.
BBQ and Pork Ribs soup are really match 😋
I want to taste your food ,how can i please reply 💓💓💓💓💓

Thanx for the subtitle in English really appreciated
Hello., watching from philippines☺️😍., i always watched your vlog., it’s a very beautiful place🥰😊and your cooking..awesome 😍💝
I love your videos so much. With everything going on in the world, these videos really bring me peace. I work from home (and have since March 2020) and I will often watch yourvideos while I'm working. They make the day go by faster and there is something about the intention behind simple tasks that I find freshing. Thank you for sharing this with us.
i like to watch your video's very much. sometimes i cook some of your dishes.
I like the way you cook it is so traditional, like my mother did.
unfortunately i am cooking on gas, because it is not possible to cook like you do.
And also Dawang is adorable.

the plants are doing very well, what you planted with your grndmother.
greetings from me from the Netherlands
Thanks for the English subtitle. We all enjoy to see the warm family dinner of fresh meals prepared by amazing cook Apenjie. Beloved Dawang is handsome. Bless All.
So beautiful. Food looks really yummy. Thank you for sharing.
I am try to make this! this summer. looks amazing and best food to eat with family
Never imagine you can used a roof slate to grill meat!
I enjoy your video very much.  Great scenery all around.  Just wondering are you planning to have your future works filmed in HDR / Dolby Vision format?
Thank you . This was an enriching presentation.  Very smooth! Cheers!
The dish looks so good but I wish you would have subtitles please.
Hello Dianxi, thank you for another amazing video. I’m glad all is well. How’s grandpa?
I love Grandma's pink hat, what a dear, smiling lady!
The hot pot looks so good.  Family is happy for a great cook.  Pass the dipping sauce. What dairy products do you make?
Cream cheese, buttermilk, butter, yogurt, hard cheese, ice cream.  So many but don’t see in dinner.
👋🏼😊
Hi...
I love watching your video
You are such a inspiration for me lots of love ❤️❤️
im from philippines...love to watch ur blog...hoping to visit ur place soon...GodBless..❤️
Everything has a use there:  the roof tiles become the BBQ tiles!!!  Great stuff...............
That's wonderful sharing, much appreciated for your hard work on that. Have a nice day!
Another beautiful video, delicious food ❤️
Who is addicted to Dianxi videos like me 😘
Dianxi!!  Thank you for Thai sub

Notice the neighbor didn't bring Jinmao (their golden retriever) with them. Dawang wouldn't allow it 😂😂

Does anyone know what kind of cleaver is being used to chop the pork bones?
Has to be one of most original series on YouTube.

I love the pear, it is very sweet and delicious. Greetings friend from El Salvador. Tecwyrrrmos my friend Dawang
Super high definition. Love to watch
Another heart-warming video !   What a sweet family gathering.  We've been so busy in our lives  that dining with family has often seemed impossible.  We are truly envious of you being able to spend priceless time often with your family.   And Dawan is always our favorite!   He's just so adorable. 🐕   Keep up the good work. 👍
Why does this video have no Vietnamese subtitles?
Happy New Year and continued success. Stay safe.............😎🙏✌
Instead of saying Chinese New Year, u can say Lunar New Year, because, in Vietnam and some other countries also celebrate the Lunar New Year.
Love from Vietnam
U should try 'a fruit for a table ' by beetroot 🌰🔪
Delicious food once again… Hello, Dianxi… Happy New Year. from 🇬🇧 uk

Traditional culture away from the clutches and influence of the CCP reflects the best of China that can be preserved for posterity when the menace is gone. I am praying for that. Meanwhile more power to TIANXIXIAOKO.
Nice

Please don’t sacrifice your weight and beauty for your videos. You and Dawang look much better when slimmer.
Super

We enjoyed watching your film while you were  making lip balm and oils and when you visit mountain. If you sell your cosmetic and beauty care products under your family name and history, people love it. Then you makes good money to rebuild your parents homes.
Dawang loves the rain..😆😆😆😆

I get so sad watching the little ones grow. It reminds me of the video Penji made of Ahao growing up. 🥺🥺🥺🥺 so heartwarming. Good food and good connections with family and friends. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
