Super beautiful! Never seen one before like that open pocket one. Really impressive that you can do them all so neatly too!
Excellent instructions with amazing results. I am excited to attempt to teach myself these traditional techniques. 🤗🤗
You make it look so simple and easy, but I bet it takes a lot of practice for most of the types. I really enjoyed your video 😁
This is too therapeutic to watch. Makes me want to make some dumplings! Thanks for sharing your cooking techniques & knowledge! I am glad to have found your channel :)
Perfect excuse for me to make more dumplings so I can practice these. Amazing!
You have done a wonderful job helping those that cannot make it home to at least have some nice looking dumplings.  I think it is like getting a hug from one's family.  Like other comments, I too have been waiting for you to do this video.  Thank you for all your hard work this past year.  I have learned a lot.   Best wishes throughout the year of the Ox. Gong Xi Fa Cai!
Love watching the tutorial. The slow wrapping really teaches me how to learn making it. Also, would you please share share the recipe to make the skin? Thank you very much. .
I've been watching your channel for a year. You've got real talent. Not only you fold them well, but the dough is soooo smooth also.
Excellent video, easy to understand and clearly explained a lot of things about dumplings I didn’t understand. I want to try making some fancier dumplings now!
The perfection of each dumpling makes me want to cry. It's soo beautiful 💕
I can watch this over and over and over!!! Learning something new every time 💖💖 you are my FAVORITE Asian chef teacher 🙌👏👏👏👏 THANK YOU
Love your channel. This is very good instructions. However, I feel again, that it looks so easy, but when I try myself it will be much more difficult 😎☺️😄
Number 11 the three-pockets dumpling is stunning! I will try these very soon!
Oh wow so many different ways!!! 😲 It’s so entertaining to watch you wrap dumplings though. ❤️ I’m gonna try couple new ways I learned today next time I make kimchi dumplings with my mom~😋 Thank you!
Making dumpling is both about taste and art ❤
Resourceful Sister, I must chime in again,  your mastery of dumpling filling preparation, wrapper folding & final preparation are world class. This, your 1st time, all-out dumpling banquet (something to do with Chinese New Year no doubt). The internet is a more peaceful place to visit, with your skillful hands & calming voice of instruction. 谢谢您，农历新年快乐
Do you do the dough for the dumplings if so could you give us the recipe please and thank you for this video it is really very helpful
Best dumpling tutorial ever.
Slow and steady hands. And showing the difficulty on each type. And slowing down at the most difficult part just so the viewer understand how to make that shape.
This is the best dumpling tutorial I've seen to date hands down
Love all your techniques! Can you share your dumpling filling recipe?
love this video, it goes straight to the point, has subtitles and is clear to understand. I struggled with the traditional way which my father only knew ( we’re chinese) and I felt like a failure since I could not do that..
You make it look so easy. Must try your fancy ways to make my kids happy.  Thank you from my heart.  Your gentle tone of voice really helps people to want to do it.
These are so cool! I hope to try it out some time!

I’m also curious if you could use the same technique to make xiao long bao
So elegant, clearly explained, and peaceful ❤ Happy (hopefully healthy!) new year and thank you for your calm creations 🥟
Thank you alot for English version! How beautiful they are and how skillful! 👏👏🌹
I love your video! Thank you so much for sharing, it was so much fun learning so many ways to wrap up dumplings 🥟! 😊💗🙏🏻
i was doing some dumplings some months ago, and i watched a bunch of tutorials. i thought, "if only magic ingredients has video for wrapping dumplings it ould be easier" and here it is!!!! thank you!!!
Excellent tutorial.. Thanks for sharing/ showing the process.. Looks so simple, I k no is mine will come out mushy for over handling to make it like yours.. ❤️❤️❤️ so glad found your channel.. making these on our block party. Yeayyy.. I think I’ll win the presentation award😘😘🤗
Omg! I didn't know there are so many similar foods too😃😍
In India, we also make the same designs just the filling is different and it is called "Perakiya" or "Gujiya".
I would love to make these. Great tutorial! Is there a video of how to make the dough/skin?
If this doesn’t inspire me to make dumplings, nothing will. Incredible
The dumplings look so lovely and delicious 💗
Such a gift. Thank you for this tutorial. I can't wait to try all of these out.

You're the beast, Xiao Gao!
I love the sun dumpling!!! So pretty!
Amazing!! Thanks you so much for this approach, is not only about the aesthetic but the flavor changes!
Thank you so much. I learnt a lot. You can do it beautifully. I Just tries a few styles. Feels accomplished.
4:34  and 6:28 are my favorite. Beautiful!!!!! Thank you for  interesting variety :-)
Such a beautiful art.  I am always sad to see food gobbled up mindlessly with no thought to the process and painstaking effort in producing fine food.
I loved and want to eat all of them ❤️
Wow! These are so beautifully “crafted”! Looked simple enough to do but still need that craftsmanship! 🍊 🍊
, Beautiful. Very methodical. 👌🏼👍🏼
You can add one more shape to it, "modak " Indian dumpling, with rice flour. 😊
I am amazed at how easy you make it look
Absolutely brilliant! Many thanks for this great video <3
I don't understand  a single word but well illustrated through the tip of your finger.  Love it.  thank you very much 👍❤

Do you make your own wrappers? Could you show us how? Or have you already made a video?
The wonderful way to wrap a Dumpling.. I like it much. Thank you so much for the tutorial. I wiil try it at my kitchen . Have a great day and stay healthy.
Amazing work with hundreds if not thousands of hours of practice.

Absolutely beautiful.  That's art. ❤ Gordon Ramsey (whom I truly believe is evil at heart) Would be proud.
Wow, smashing ways how to fold dumpling in every way... Thumbs UP
They look so good! I will try some new folding styles next time I make dumplings for sure 😄
Great job, could you or someone give me the ingredients of this paste plz !
I’ve been making dumplings allll day. I will try some of these new folds to keep things interesting!
Believe it or not but Nr. 12 is used in Sardinia (Italy), often used with potato+cheese filling.
These are some of the most beautiful looking dumplings I have seen in my life. And I eat a lot of dumplings... lol
Beautiful. 4, 7 and 12 are my favorites.
Thank you for your time teaching me how to make dumping 😘😍
You are masterfully talented. I am so amazed and impressed.love your show

Beautiful video and amazing skill as always. 
What kind of filling is that?
Thank you so much. It looks easy but I only can make it like a mien bao shape not like those ones you make 🥲
Thank you my friend for sharing video very informative I've learn a lot!
THANK YOU !!! Your vids are just awesome !!! Keep them coming ;)
Very nice we are making as well, but making the dough is a bit difficult and take times. We can not find in Germany the ready made dough. I will be glad if you share with us the dough as well.
In India, 16th method sweet r made called chandrakala, n 2nd methods sweet called gujiya
Wow really awesome look so' yummy 😃 Big Lk  package 💯grow together
This seems very helpful.thank youu
Yo i wish this vid was out a year ago 🤣

This is really magic.
Beautiful art!
Thank you very much! (what`s the name of the music?_ Thanks in advance. Greetings from Mexico
Me on version #1: Why won't the wrapper stay closed?
Her: These are the beginner techniques. Next week's intermediate wrapping tutorial: the fibonacci spiral.

Thank you, and Happy New Year!
Omg these look so cute 🥰
4:15 i love that style!
this is pure magic!!
Very nice. Thank you!
How do I make the sheet?
The problem is the dumpling wrapper does not stick well.
I came to see your video from Korea far away!! I like the videos so much that I subscribe. I will visit you often!!
I love your recipe!! It looks very delicious! I should try it too! It's 2 a.m. in Korea, and I'm so hungry! I want to eat all your videos!!🤣🤣🤣
Many thanks.Only watch you did it is relaxing enough.
What flour you used maida or wheat flour?
They look like seashells! I like when art and food come together
The 11 way it's little bit complicated. As you know the dough still raw then once you stuffed then how you will fried it later. Or if you cook it in oven the stuffing will be so dry 
Or I'm wrong
I remember my mom make curry puff and folded using technique number 15 or 16. To make it more beautiful when fries my mom put three layers of flatten dough with smaller diameter at the top and biggest at the bottom. When fried it will look nice.
15 is the smallest calzone ever. Looks amazing though!
Thank you I will try to do my best as your 😆
easy learning video😍🙏
Super, love from South India

Many of those we do in India.
But i don't know how to do it.

Thanks
Miss , please..make video for how to make wrap dumpling with righ amd easy😁😊, couse if i want to make dumpling, i always buy in big market..thanku😘
I'm here because i'm planning to make dumplings tomorrow.
I was not searching for it, but watched the whole thing :D 
very interesting, I have to practice now
Looks easy. 
When i try : OH WOW WHAT...  😂
We make bigger version of some of these momos and soup on side with sauce and Nepali momos with soup and hot sauce in a bowl. These days,  Indians eat momos as well with spices in their ingredients with sauce without soup. So, Tibetans momos and shabhaklep are bigger version of yours. Our preparation is manually done from scratch without or mostly with the family.
10th is very Turkish way to do dumplings, smaller pieces of course. Delicious 😋
So beautiful Cindy thank you for sharing enjoy your weekend

I often use the first version.

Best of all, your videos are so soothing, you have a great attitude and do everything from the heart 💖 

Thank you 😊
No.8 is used in restaurants a lot for the boiled Jiaozi, which I do by myself 'cause it's the laziest way;
No. 11 is never seen and eaten before;
No.12/13 is seen and eaten but never tried before and will do it later;
No. 16 is what i did in the childhood when the wraps left and the filling insuffecient.
Thanks for your exhibiting all this with the high defifinition details...
Absolutely in love! Thank you for sharing this lovely video, I am inspired to try and learn all of your tecnique ❤️
